/******************************************************************************
Binary Tree: Atmost two children
Binary Search Tree: (LeftNode < parentNode <rightNode)

Types of trees:
 Uniary tree(Atmost 1 children), Binary tree(Atmost 2 children), Trinary tree(Atmost 3 children)

Q. How much nodes in a maximum binary tree? ( 2^(h+1) - 1 )

Types of Trees
--------------
1. Full Binary tree: either thry have 0 or 2 children (not one)
2. Complete Binary tree: All the level should filled.(or fill it from the LHS (No holes) )
3. Perfect Binary tree: All the levels completely full.  ( 2^(h+1) - 1 ) nodes


Depth First Search
------------------
searches like it move deapth(1 level deep) either in LHS or RHS then it comes up

Depth First Search
------------------
it searches like level wise( 1st level,second level,etc)
